## Disclaimers / important information

GoToSocial is still in alpha and **may be unstable**. You can read [the roadmap](https://github.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) to check the progress of GoToSocial's features.

GoToSocial require a **dedicated root domain**, for example: gotosocial.domain.tld.

This package is not-working SSO (single-sign on) or LDAP integration.  
You will have a separate account from the rest of your Yunohost server, potentially with a different username and password.

GoToSocial **does not provide a user interface**.  
You will need to use a Mastodon-compatible client such as [Tusky](https://tusky.app/) on Android or an instance of [Pinafore](https://pinafore.social/) on the Web.
